# SimBlock Pattern Library

This is a comprehensive library of workflow patterns for scientific computing, data processing, and simulation workflows. Each pattern is implemented as a Blockly block that generates the corresponding Airflow code.

## Categories

### Simulation Patterns
Patterns for executing and managing scientific simulations:

- [Simulation Execution](simulation/simulation_execution.md) - Run a single simulation
- [Parameter Sweep](simulation/parameter_sweep.md) - Execute simulations across a range of parameters
- [Monte Carlo Simulation](simulation/monte_carlo.md) - Run randomized simulations with varying inputs
- [Convergence Loop](simulation/convergence_loop.md) - Run iterations until convergence is reached
- [Ensemble Simulation](simulation/ensemble.md) - Manage multiple simulation runs with different initial conditions
- [Model Calibration](simulation/model_calibration.md) - Iteratively adjust parameters to fit observed data
- [Sensitivity Analysis](simulation/sensitivity_analysis.md) - Assess how output varies with input changes

### Data Patterns
Patterns for data processing and management:

- [Data Transfer](data/data_transfer.md) - Move data between locations
- [ETL Process](data/etl_process.md) - Extract, transform, and load data
- [Data Validation](data/data_validation.md) - Verify data quality and integrity
- [Data Partitioning](data/data_partitioning.md) - Split data into manageable chunks
- [Data Aggregation](data/data_aggregation.md) - Combine and summarize multiple datasets
- [Data Format Conversion](data/format_conversion.md) - Convert between data formats
- [Data Filtering](data/data_filtering.md) - Remove or select data based on criteria

- [Pipeline Synchronization](workflow/synchronization.md) - Coordinate dependencies between tasks
- [Task Timeout](workflow/task_timeout.md) - Apply timeouts to long-running tasks
- [Notification](workflow/notification.md) - Send alerts and notifications
- [Checkpointing](workflow/checkpointing.md) - Save intermediate states for recovery

### Infrastructure Patterns
Patterns for infrastructure and resource management:

- [Resource Allocation](infrastructure/resource_allocation.md) - Allocate computational resources
- [Container Execution](infrastructure/container_execution.md) - Run tasks in containers
- [Cloud Integration](infrastructure/cloud_integration.md) - Integrate with cloud services
- [HPC Job Submission](infrastructure/hpc_job.md) - Submit jobs to HPC clusters
- [Distributed Computation](infrastructure/distributed_computation.md) - Distribute work across nodes
- [Database Operations](infrastructure/database_operations.md) - Interact with databases
- [API Integration](infrastructure/api_integration.md) - Connect to external APIs

## Using Patterns

Each pattern documentation includes:

1. **Description**: What the pattern does and when to use it
2. **Block Interface**: How to configure the block
3. **Generated Code**: The Airflow code it generates
4. **Examples**: Sample workflows using the pattern
5. **Best Practices**: Tips for effective usage
